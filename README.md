# GoogleMapsAnimations        

"GoogleMapsAnimations" is an awesome first of its type android library for showing a ripple and radar animations on a google map, e.g show catchment area of an earthquake where ripples have been felt, give prominence to certain markers which need to be highlighted. Also add a ripple when your user is moving on the map and give a #PokemonGo type ripple effect and also add a radar type effect to show users that you are searching in certain area

Below samples show the ripple effect in action:

# Build the sample
To build the sample project, enable the project explorer under Android view, just go to res/values and find **google_maps_api.xml(debug)**. Generate a google maps API key for yourself and enter it in this file, the SHA-1 fingerprint already given in the file is mine but you should generate your own. Follow these if you need some help.
